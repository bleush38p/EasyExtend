Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

## Why do I need EasyExtend?
EasyExtend opens the gateway to infinite extended possibilities in Scratch. In essence, it opens the gateway for Scratch to use javascript, the native scripting language of the internet. This means that Scratch can use more functions, with your permission of course, of your browser than it can normally.

## How safe is EasyExtend?
Ideally, EasyExtend will never run unconfirmed code on your system. When you accept an install request for EEXT approved libraries, only approved code that is hosted on EasyExtend's repository will be run. You can read each extension's description and check its permissions to verify that it's something you're okay with running. If not, just press cancel. However, sometimes, a project creator needs to do something that's not available in EasyExtend's approved libraries. In that case, it is up to you as the user to decide whether you trust the author or not. *As a rule, don't install unapproved extensions in projects that weren't created by someone you trust.* Remember that an unapproved extension might not do exactly what its description says and it *might not abide by its permissions*.

## Why isn't it working?
Hopefully, EasyExtend will work perfectly for everyone. However, it's possible that in some cases it won't. Head over to the [troubleshooting](#ts) page (WIP) to see if your problem can be fixed.

## This looks cool! How do I get started?
Just head over to the [quick start](#start) page! It'll help you install the userscript and create your first project.

## This looks cool! I want to contribute!
Awesome! You can check out the [extension developers](#dev) page if that's what you're interested in or you can pop on over to the [github repo](https://github.com/bleush38p/EasyExtend) if you'd like to help develop EasyExtend itself. Feel free to submit a pull request or create an issue for any feature or bug.

## How do I share a project with extensions? It says I can't!
It's important to remember that the Scratch Team doesn't want a lot of projects out there that need something on top of Scratch, both for safety reasons and simply the fact that many users might not want to or be able to install something else. **Remember that a project that you share that uses extensions will most likely never be able to be featured or curated, and that some Scratch users won't be able to use it.**

If you're still ready to share it, there are a few things you can try. The way to get your project shared is to remove all extension blocks, so Scratch doesn't see them. Once it's shared, you can add them back in and continue to edit the project, so long as you don't unshare it again.

### Method one: share a new project

The first and easiest method is to share a new project, and upload the project with extensions inside the shared project. To do this, go to **File -> Download to your computer**. This will save a complete, bundled-up version of the project onto your computer. If the project has a lot of assets or the internet connection is slow, this might take a moment. Make sure know where you're saving the project and what you're calling it.

Now, go to **File -> New** to create a new project, and rename it to the same thing as the original project. (Make sure to fill in the instructions/credits/tags if you have those written for the original project as well.)

Then, **Share** the project. You'll be kicked out to the project page, but you can click **See inside** to go back in.

Finally, **File -> Upload from your computer** and select the project that you saved. Once it finishes uploading, your project will be shared! You can check to make sure everything survived all the downloading and uploading okay, and if you need you can always redownload and upload the original project.

### Method two: strip a project

The second method involves deleting all sprites or scripts from a project that have the extension blocks. You can add them to your backpack or download them so that once the project is shared you can put the back.
