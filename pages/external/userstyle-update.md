Important Userstyle Changes
===========================
Thank you for using my userstyle, Scratch 2.0 according to shinkansen.

Unfortunately, I've had to completely cease development of the userstyle in the last few months, which means it will receive no more updates from me. As you have no doubt noticed, the userstyle is not by any means finished.

**Instructions to remove the yellow banner can be found below.**

If you would like to continue using the userstyle, you are able to do so (and remove the yellow banner) but by installing it you understand that it is unfinished and accept that you cannot hold me responsible for any side effects of its use.

Alternatively, you can choose to install a different version of the userstyle in which all content styles have been removed except for the navigation bar. I highly recommend this option, as the bar still looks great even without the rest of the site styled.

Lastly, you can uninstall the userstyle completely.

*If anyone would like to pick up the project they can message me on Scratch or github.*

## 1. Uninstallation
This step is required, even if you plan to reinstall the userstyle next.

#### Click on the stylish icon in the extension bar of your browser.
Look to the right of the place where you type the URL. The button is a white letter "S" on a multicolored background.

#### Select "Manage installed styles."
It is the last option in the popup that appears. A extension page should open in a new tab.

#### Locate "Scratch 2.0 according to shinkansen" and press "Delete"
When prompted, choose "OK".

## 2. Reinstall the style
If you would like the complete but unfinished style you can click <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/109083/scratch-2-0-according-to-shinkansen-dnu" target="_blank">here</a> to install it.

If you would like to install the navigation bar only you can click <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/109081/shinkansen-scratch-bar-only" target="_blank">here</a>.

# Thank you!
