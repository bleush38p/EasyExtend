EasyExtend
==========

Userscript friendly easy extension loader for Scratch 2.0.


## Installation

Installation of EasyExtend is simple if you have a userscript manager, like [Tampermonkey (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Greasemonkey (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

You can find and install the userscript [here](https://github.com/bleush38p/EasyExtend/raw/master/main.user.js).

If your userscript manager automatically processes .user.js files, it should be able to install EasyExtend simply by clicking the "instal" button. If so you can test EasyExtend out by seeing inside any Scratch project and checking under the "more blocks" tab for EEXT/importer blocks.

If your userscript manager did not automatically process the script, you may need to download it and install it manually. You should refer to the instructions that go along with your browser or userscript manager.
