Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

### Why do I need EasyExtend?
EasyExtend opens the gateway to infinite extended possibilities in Scratch. In essence, it opens the gateway for Scratch to use javascript, the native scripting language of the internet. This means that Scratch can use more functions, with your permission of course, of your browser than it can normally.

### How safe is EasyExtend?
Ideally, EasyExtend will never run unconfirmed code on your system. When you accept an install request for EEXT approved libraries, only approved code that is hosted on EasyExtend's repository will be run. You can read each extension's description and check its permissions to verify that it's something you're okay with running. If not, just press cancel. However, sometimes, a project creator needs to do something that's not available in EasyExtend's approved libraries. In that case, it is up to you as the user to decide whether you trust the author or not. *As a rule, don't install unapproved extensions in projects that weren't created by someone you trust.* Remember that an unapproved extension might not do exactly what its description says and it *might not abide by its permissions*.

### Why isn't it working?
Ideally, EasyExtend will work perfectly for everyone. However, it's possible that in some cases it won't. Head over to the [troubleshooting](#ts) page (WIP) to see if your problem can be fixed.

### This looks cool! How do I get started?
Just head over to the [quick start](#start) page! It'll get you started.

### This looks cool! I want to contribute!
Awesome! You can check out the [extension developers](#dev) page if that's what you're interested in or you can pop on over to the [github repo](https://github.com/bleush38p/EasyExtend) for EasyExtend. Feel free to submit a pull request with tested, documented code and if it looks good it'll get added to EasyExtend!
