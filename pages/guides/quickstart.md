[‚ùÆ](#guides) EasyExtend Quick Start Guide
============================
This guide will help you get started using EasyExtend.

1. Install a userscript manager
-------------------------------
In this guide we will be using [Tampermonkey (chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) to manage userscripts. It's highly recommended that you use Tampermonkey, as it's been the most thoroughly tested and it'll be easier to offer support. If you would like to help make EasyExtend work on your favorite userscript manager, feel free to contribute to the project on github.

Once you have installed Tampermonkey, its icon should be visible to the right of your address bar or wherever extensions usually can be found in your browser. If you can see that, you're all set to head on to step two. If not, ensure that the extension installed correctly and try restarting your browser.

2. Install EasyExtend
---------------------
[Click here to install EasyExtend.](https://rawgit.com/bleush38p/EasyExtend/master/main.user.js)

As long as your userscript manager automatically detects userscript files, a window should pop up asking you whether you would like to install EasyExtend. Read through the information on that page, and, if everything looks good, you can click install.

If a window didn't pop up asking you to install, you may need to take more steps to get the userscript up and running. Refer to the documentation that comes with your userscript manager.


3. Take it for a test drive
---------------------------
It's time to make sure everything's working! Open any Scratch Project page [(like this one!)](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/31406042/) and look for a button with the letter "E" on it. If you're on the project page, it'll be on the navigation bar, to the right of your username. If you're in the project editor, you can find it to the left of the "share" or "remix" button.

If you can't see the button, check the [troubleshooting](#ts) page for some tips.

Try pressing the button. If the letter turns green, you're all good! You can look for the importer blocks in the "more blocks" category. If it turns red, or doesn't change at all, head over to the [troubleshooting](#ts) page to see what went wrong.
